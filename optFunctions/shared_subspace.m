%manifold optimization for PCA. This file is called by other files and it
%has three options for no constraint and with constraint optimizations.
%N1 = nonshared subspace 1 
%d1 = dimension for 1, not used
%N2 = nonshared subspace 2 
%d2 = dimension for 2, not used
%d3 = dimension for shared subspace
% Generate random problem data.
% Q2 is what we need for the shared subspace
