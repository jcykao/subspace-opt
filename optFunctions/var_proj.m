function y = var_proj(Q,C,eigsum)
% function for finding variance explained in a certain projection
% Q: A matrix with orthogonal columns that define the subspace
% C: Covariance matrix of the data with the same row dimension as Q
% eigsum: sum of the largest k eigenvalues of C where k = size(Q,2)
